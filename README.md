# Bitcoin Arbitrage Model

This Jupyter notebook explores opportunities for Bitcoin arbitrage between January 1 and April 1, 2018 between the Coinbase and Bitstamp exchanges.

This is a challenge assignment from Rice's FinTech Bootcamp program due on June 30, 2022. The purpose of this assignment is to further develop our experiences working with Jupyter notebooks and incorporating our knowledge to date. 

## Technologies

This program is written in Python (3.7.13) and developed using JupyterLabs notebooks using Windows. Libraries incorporated are matplotlib (3.1.1), pathlib, and pandas (1.1.5) (see parenthesis for versions used in program development).

## Installation Guide

Downloading the code & associated files using `git clone` from the repository is sufficient to download the program, ensure that the associated libaries (see Technologies section) are installed on your machine as well. If there are any issues with the library functions please refer to the versions used for app development (see Technnologies section for this information as well).  Please note that this is a Jupyter notebook. 

## Usage

Although the purpose of this notebook is to provide a lookback at potential arbitrage opportunities for bitcoin, the data and code can easily be adapted to look for statistical arbitrage opportunities for other commodities / securities on different exchanges. 


## Contributors

Project contributors are the Rice FinTech bootcamp program team (instructur Eric Cadena) who developed the tasks for this project along with myself (Paula K) who's written the code to explore the data.
